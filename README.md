# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
# Overview
This project demonstrates how to recognize handwritten digits using a deep learning model trained on the MNIST dataset. 
The project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Python and TensorFlow/Keras to classify images of digits from 0 to 9.
